			<h2>What Drew Us Together</h2>
			<p>The two soon discovered that they had a love of music, dance Disney and being generally
			silly. This made their affection for one another continue to grow. When their first
			Valentine's Day date came around, Adrian made a point to ask Katie what she was looking
			for in a relationship. They both agreed that they were looking for someone to spend their 
			live swith and get married. Adrian told Katie he loved her, and a little while after that
			Katie told him the same. Adrian knew he had a keeper and planned to keep it that way.</p>

			<h2>Getting Engaged</h2>
			<p>After a comical encounter with asking Katie's father for her hand in marriage, Adrian 
			Had to come up with a way to make it special. Luckily, one of Adrian's coworkers was a 
			photographer. "The plan was set, now it was time to execute. He asked Katie to her favorite
			restaurant, dressed up, and popped the question in front of a big local Christmas tree.
			Adrian had a future wife! The hidden photographer added the perfect touch. (Thanks Aaron!)</p>

			<h2>The Big Day</h2>
			<p>Now the two had to get busy. Planning, colors, venue, food, music and all the other joys of
			getting a wedding together. They were stressed out most of the time, but they knew that when
			the big day arrived they would be husband and wife and the rest of their lives would bve an 
			adventure that they would help each other through</p>

			<h2>Happily ever after</h2>
			<p>The "I Do's" were done and now the fun begins. What does the future hold for them? Babies are
			one thing. (Or two or more things). More importantly, it will be them handling whatever comes at
			them with love and teamwork.
			I am grateful to God for this woman in my life and I pray He will guide us through whatever
			comes our way. I couldn't ask for a better partner in life. Now let's get hitched!</p>
